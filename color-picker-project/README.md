## Features

**Placeholder**
This can be a list of features or just a description of what this project does / what can be done with it. I prefer presenting information in a bullet or numbered list as it improves the ability to scan through and gather information quickly. Short, specific pieces of information are much easier to digest.

## Tech Stack / Dependencies

**Placeholder**
Listing other peoples work that your project relies on is not only in good taste it helps show what your project is built on and adds insight to compatibility/integration with outside projects.

Dependency lists can also help others see what tech you are familiar with. If you are hunting for a new job listing out the cool new tech stuff you used in a project can make it stand out a bit more.

This too is usually a list and I prefer to make each dependency a link directing the reader to more information on that package or additional project.
